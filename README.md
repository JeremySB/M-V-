# M(V)
M(V), named after the equation for momentum, p=mv, is the first game in the Unity engine that a few friends and I created over a few weeks for a class project. Our main goal was to learn more about the fundamentals of Unity by creating a basic game, in this case a spaceship simulator where the objective is to get through the course and beat previous times. Being able to control the ship's momentum is key to getting better times.
