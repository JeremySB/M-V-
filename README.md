# M(V)
M(V), named after the equation for momentum, p=mv, is the first 3D game that a few friends and I created using the Unity engine. Our main goal was to learn more about the fundamentals of Unity by creating a basic game over a few weeks for a class project, in this case a spaceship simulator where the objective is to get through the course and beat previous times. Being able to control the ship's momentum is key to getting better times.
